AUTOMATIC CAR HEADLIGHT TURNOFF CIRCUIT 
 
Headlights of vehicles pose a great danger during night driving. The drivers 
of most vehicles use high, bright beam while driving at night. This causes a 
discomfort to the person travelling from the opposite direction and therefore 
experiences a sudden glare for a short period of time. This is caused due to the high 
intense headlight beam from the other vehicle coming towards the one from the 
opposite direction. In this project, an automatic headlight dimmer which uses a 
Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor has been designed to dim the headlight of 
on-coming vehicles to avoid human eye effects. This automatically switched the 
high beam into low beam, therefore reducing the glare effect by sensing the light 
intensity value of approaching vehicle and also eliminated the requirement of 
manual switching by the driver which was not done at all times. MATLAB software 
was employed in designing the project. The Keil software was also employed to 
program the microcontroller. At the time the spread light from other sources reached 
the sensor, its intensity would be very much reduced below the triggering threshold 
level. The sensitivity of a photo detector determined the relationship between the 
light falling on the device and the resulting output signal. A server module could be 
included to this system for receiving and storing headlight rays parameters 
information in a database application.
