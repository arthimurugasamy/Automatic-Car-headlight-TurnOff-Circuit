# Automatic-Car-headlight-TurnOff-Circuit
 An automatic headlight dimmer system using an LDR sensor automatically switches headlights from high beam to low beam to reduce glare for oncoming drivers. It detects light intensity and eliminates the need for manual switching, enhancing safety. The system was developed using MATLAB for simulation and Keil software for programming.
